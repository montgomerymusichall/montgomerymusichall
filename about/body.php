                This venue isn't just a new "trendy" night spot. It's an organic and open place that you'll really want to "take everything in". It is inspired by music itself, by the diversity and cultures that it has spun off over the centuries. Whether it is roaring licks of British and American rock, smoky blues, blue grass, lounge, hard rock, reggae or gospel. We are dedicated to it.

                Every night promises something unique. We plan to host a variety of shows and events. The gamut including local and national acts, "free for all" nights where anyone and I do mean "anyone", can bring their own talents to the stage. We also plan to have duelling pianos, and pot luck jams as well. In 2015 come and see us, and I think you will leave each time feeling inspired!
